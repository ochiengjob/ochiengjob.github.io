Hi, I am Job Ochieng, an engineer, ethical technologist and lifelong learner passionate about designing secure, intelligent and sustainable systems.
I bridge the worlds of electrical engineering, Python development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity to create solutions that make a real-world impact.

My journey is driven by curiosity and guided by ethics — from building resilient energy systems and automation tools to developing civic-tech platforms that empower communities.
I believe technology should not only work efficiently but also responsibly, safeguarding the people and ecosystems it serves.

When I’m not engineering or coding, you’ll find me exploring new ideas, mentoring peers, or experimenting with innovative projects that challenge the status quo.
